* Transferred inital Graphics
* Implemented Drawing mechanics
* Completed conversion of Level Class
* Level loading is piss poor
* Implemented Enemy class
* Created a Vector2 class which emulates the one found in the XNA framework - Converted all instances of Points to Vector2's
* Redid Level loading code so it runs, still needs work to make it a nice system.

05/07/14
* Imported more of the graphics: towers, bullets etc.
* Implemented the wave, wavemanager, tower, basic tower, and bullet class.
* Wave class now works.
* Reorganised classes into a better file structure.
* Continued to develop the Vector2 class as it's functionality needed expansion.
* Implemented rotation code for bullets: Pretty sure it won't work.

07/07/14
* Gun now rotates correctly.
* Bullets now travel in the correct direction.
* Began to impliment slow tower: Works, but does not slow.
* Bullets damage and kill enemies. Hard to tell without Healthbars.
* Slow tower now correctly slows enemies. Currently only targets enemies without a modifier attarched via a TEMP method.
* Need to remove this temp method and make it so it only targets enemies if it's modifier is better than the one currently affecting the enemy. 
* Began using a new rotation method that works without clipping.
* Transparency, Clipping, Scaling issues and all graphics related errors are now fixed.

08/07/14
* Implemented a radius feature.

12/07/14
* Integrated Player.cs into Mainstate.cs: it was superflurous to have them seperate.
* Implemented a basic Toolbar graphic.

23/07/14
* Implemented the upgrade tower visual code: need to find a way of setting Opacity in the Tower class, current method does not work.
* Altered tower code so that the graphics are not required to be passed to a tower when it is created.
* Began to impliment a GUI Input system.
* Renamed classes to conform to the X_Y_Z.cs name structure.
* Changed State Changing from accessing a property to a method - this allows the buttons list to be automatically cleared when changing a state.
* Converted Play button on MainMenu to use the new system.
* BEgan to add Tower creation GUI.
* Creating towers recoded: the tower now has no parameters in it's constructor, these are now facilitated in Main States AddTower() method. 
	This is to facilitate creation of towers - they don't have a position when first initialised. (Tower is created and then placed).
* Finished the implimentation of the Basic Tower. Had to rejiggle a lot of stuff, to add new towers just copy the basic tower button.

24/07/14
* Renamed all Draw methods to Redraw
* Altered implimentation of Tower Buttons so that it works without Vector2.Distance throwing a NullReferenceException error.
* Added graphics while tower is being placed.
* Added Slow Tower button.

26/07/14
* Began to add Keyboard based input.
* Towers can no longer be placed on top of eachother.
* Upgrade now uses "U" keyboard press.
* Fully implemented a Keyboard based input system.
* Towers now have a max upgrade level and cost money to upgrade.
* Implemented Selling mechanics by using the "S" key
* New Title Graphic

28/07/14
* Resized the tilesize from 40x40 to 25x25.
* Edited the spite draw event such that it can center things bigger than the tile size to a tile. Expect bugs.
* Resized all the graphics that needed it to still work/look good and are being used.
* Modifed look of Toolbar to mock up what a UI would look like, and adjusted the tower button positions to suit.
* Added a Menu button to the toolbar. No functionality yet.
* Began to impliment a speed modifier coefficient for speeding up the game. I first made all references to Velocity 
	is a property in Sprite, even those local. I then modifed the property to be divided by the modifier so that all uses of 
	the speed are modifed by the global speed modifier
* Made all references to all variables via a property for Sprite. May do so for all other classes if no bugs arise.
* Added a method in WaveManager which handles modifying spawning rates when the global speed modifier is altered.
* Encased all multiple thread spanning variables in try/catch statements. Seems to stop the problems with exceptions, may result in bugs.


TODO:
Better wave spawning system: Player initialised waves, multiple waves onscreen etc.
Input
Tower Upgrades
Healthbars
The world is fliped: all X coordinates refer to Y coordinate space and vice versa. Somethign is wrong with TIleX and 
TileY, I think, which gives all towers flipped coordinates when they are placed (they are given their coords from TileX and Y).
Fix adjusting wave timers when changic global speed modifier.
